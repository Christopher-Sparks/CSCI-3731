1. The difference between int and const int is that const int will not allow you to change the value of the variable once it has been initialized.

2. A function definition introduces the identifier and describes the attributes of the function. The declaration is only what the compiler requires to accept references to that identifier, they allow you to define functions wherever you like. 

3. Two reasons you would use an unsigned int. One, since there are no negative values it can hold larger numbers. Two, since it can't hold negative numbers it can be useful in places where negative numbers would be invalid. 

4. The variable sum needs to be assigned to the number 0, since there is a chance the sum can be assigned to some arbitrary garbage. 

5. 0 is being assigned to n. Therefore, the boolean value in the if statement will come out to false and not print the statement. To change this change the = to ==. 

6. By using the sizeof() function, it will return the number of bytes of the argument given. MAC OS: char = 1 byte, short = 2 bytes, int = 4 bytes, long = 8 bytes
